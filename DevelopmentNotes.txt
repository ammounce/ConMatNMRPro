-AMM: Add nutation, rep sweep, ect. to experiment types
-AMM: Add experiment type variable to distinguish multiple types of expts. 
-AMM:Add temperature variable and storage space in statswave
-AMM:Add button to view storage wave alongside description of variable
-AMM: Make a more advanced time wave generator to acommodate Tecmag and use many of the Magres
      features.
-AMM: change gyromagnetic ratio label to gamma/2pi and add use gyro checkbox

-AMM: Change root:analysis: folder to root:ConMatNMRPro:
-AMM: Change main panel to a panel for all analysis with tabs to switch between screens
